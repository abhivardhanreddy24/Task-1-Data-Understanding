Initial Task – Exploring Dataset Types and Their Structures

AI & ML Internship Opportunity
 
Task Title
Understanding the Dataset Types and Their Structures

 Description of the Task
The main goal of this task is to get a good understanding of how a dataset is structured and what kind of quality the data has before using any machine learning (ML). Understanding your data is a key part of the ML process. Having a good understanding of your data helps to inform you of the data types, the amount of missing values, the target variable, and whether or not there is an imbalance in the data. It can also help to determine if the data will be suitable for your intended ML application.

In this task, I analysed the "Titanic Dataset" using the Python Programming Language and the Pandas Library.

 Dataset Used
"Titanic Dataset"

The Titanic Dataset provides information on passengers – passenger class, passenger age, passenger gender, passenger fare, embarkation port, survival status for each passenger – in the dataset.

The Titanic Dataset has one row for each passenger and one column for each passenger attribute.

 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python Programming Language
- Pandas Library
- NumPy Library
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Github

 Steps Performed to Complete the Task
1. Load the Titanic Dataset
2. View the First and Last Rows of the Dataset
3. Identify Numeric vs. Categorical and Binary Features
4. Identify Target Variable and Input Features
5. Use `df.info()` and df.describe() Functions to Help Understand Your Data
6. Review Unique Values in the Categorical Columns
7. Determine Data Quality Problems such as Missing Values and Imbalanced Data


 Summary of Findings
- The Titanic Dataset has "891 rows and 12 columns".
- The Titanic dataset contains both Numeric and Categorical features.
- The Titanic dataset has missing values in Age, Cabin and Embarked columns.
- Target variable is imbalanced.
- Dataset is suitable for machine learning after preprocessing.
